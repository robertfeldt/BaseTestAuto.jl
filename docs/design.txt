= Test assertions

Test assertions (TAs) are implemented as separate types and takes care of the 
sampling and checking of values given an expression to be asserted.

TAs take care of the sampling of values by transforming the expression to be
sampled into an expression which will be sampled by the @test macro code (since it 
is executed in the context of where the macro is invoked). This transformation
is done in a static function which is dispatched on the (symbol) name of the
TA type.

To define a new TA implement:

- TAT
  - a type that derives from DirectAssertion or MultiAssertion
- Select an EvaluationResult type ERT or implement one that derives from EvaluationResult
  - a datum of this type will be returned from the sampling expression when it is evaluated
- transform_to_sampling_expression(::Type{Val{:TAT}}, expr::Expr)
  - returns the sampling expression that will be evaluated (in the code the @test macro expands to) and return the evaluation result that is then checked
- check(::TAT, ::ERT)
  - should check the sampled result value to see if the assertion is fulfilled
- multicheck(::TAT)
  - should perform the final check on all checked samples (for MultiAssertions) at the end before the test set finishes

- An assertion is either fulfilled or not, regardless if its a single sampled or multi sampled assertion.
- A direct assertion can only be fulfilled (or not) depending on a single sampled value.
- A multi assertion needs one or more sampled values before it can be fulfilled or not. It keeps some state to judge if its fulfilled or not.
- If an assertion is finalized (isfinalized() is true) it can no longer change regardless of how many new samples are added; it will stay a Pass or a Fail. Thus we need no longer take any samples or check the condition. 
  - DirectAssertions are never finalized. They can always take new samples and check based on that.

If you need custom description of what went wrong implement:

- show(::IO, ::TAT, ::Fail) to return a string used to describe what went wrong

== Sampling expression transformation
Function: transform_to_sampling_expression(::Type{Val{:TAType}}, expr::Expr)
where TAType is the name of the type of the TA.

The returned expression should return an EvaluationResult datum when evaluated.
This evaluation result is then checked in the check method of the TA.

== Test assertion types

- TestAssertion (abstract)
  - DirectAssertion (abstract)
    - PredicateTrueAssertion, a normal test predicate that should eval to true
    - ComparisonAssertion, a comparison of values that should eval to true
  - MultiAssertion (abstract)
    - AccumulatorAssertion, accumulates values and the performs a final check
    - PerformanceAssertion, measures performance and ensures it is within bounds
    - StochasticAssertion, accumulates values and then performs stochastic checks on them

Even though the ComparisonAssertion can simply be implemented as a PredicateTrueAssertion
we define it in order to do more detailed failure reporting when it does not hold.

== EvaluationResult types

- EvaluationResult
  - Returned, when a value is returned normally when evaluating the sampled expression
  - Threw, when an exception was thrown when evaluating the sampled expression
